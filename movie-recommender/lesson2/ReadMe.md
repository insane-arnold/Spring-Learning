# Loose coupling

In this lesson we have same thing as in lesson1 but here we have created an interface Filter
which is implemented by CollaborativeFilter and ContentBasedFilter.

We create an object of Filter and assign an object of ContentBasedFilter and CollaboratorFilter
based on our requirement.

This shows loose coupling of the code
