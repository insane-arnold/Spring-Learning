Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) is an interface that standardizes dependency injection for Java EE. 
It defines different annotations for dependency injection like @Named, @Inject, @Scope, @Singleton, etc. 
Different CDI implementation frameworks provide support and functionality for these annotations.


<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>
    <version>1</version>
</dependency>

@Named = @Componenets
@Inject = @Autowired
